# VMAuthentication
Welcome to another plugin I've made! It's called: VMAuthentication.
How does this work?
This plugin is mainly designed for authentication. If you want your server fully secured, without any impersonators or hackers, then you can add this to your server.
How to install?
1. Download the latest Builds from: https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/iZeaoGamer/VMAuthentication/VMAuthentication
2. It should come as a .phar file.
3. When you've downloaded it, add the .phar file from your server files. Go to plugins files where you keep your plugins, and then put it 4. there.
5. When you've done that, restart the server.
That's all complete.
If you have any issues occuring, please open the issues tab. I will try and get it fixed ASAP.
